Hello this is the Voltage Repository for our final project!
Remember to save the most up to date version of Voltage Here
Have a nice day!

THINGS TO WORK ON
- One way platform script is still buggy, take a look if your able
- We have no enemies yet, I (CJ) have a hard time doing enemy AI so can someone else pick up that baton
- Need to figure out power ups. 
- We need sound and art for everything.
- Once we get enemies we can create actual levels, which is needed to figure out our scoring system.


NOTES

-When enemies are hit with a projectile the event 'Hit' will be triggered
-Hazards and enmies have different tags and layers, assign appropriately
-Physics 2d Collision matrix should be marked so that 'NoHurt' Layer is not affected by Enemies or Hazards
- When adding scenes to build settings, Main Menu is first (index 0)

You can also export individual pieces as assets and they will update if an old version already exist in the file your using
Have a nice day.

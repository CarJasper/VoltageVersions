Hello this is the Voltage Repository for our final project!
Remember to save the most up to date version of Voltage Here
Have a nice day!

NOTES

-When enemies are hit with a projectile the event 'Hit' will be triggered
-Hazards and enmies have different tags and layers, assign appropriately
-Physics 2d Collision matrix should be marked so that 'NoHurt' Layer is not affected by Enemies or Hazards

=======
The 2 tags show how to set up your layers and tags as well as the collision matrix. There should then assign themselves to the right
places automatically, if not they are pretty self explanitory. You will also need to add the scenes to your build settings, make sure Main Menu is first (index 0)

You can also export individual pieces as assets and they will update if an old version already exist in the file your using
Have a nice day.
